# Custom Database Management System

This project is a simple yet powerful database system with built-in user, group, and permission management.

## Features

### Initial Root Setup
- Enter the root password on first use.
- Password is securely stored (hashed with salt).

### User and Group Management
- Create users and login securely.
- Create groups with passwords; users can join groups using the password.
- Track user online/offline status to prevent multiple logins.

### Security
- Passwords are hashed with salt for protection.
- Built-in logging system to track all activities.
- Users can view logs related to:
  - Their own activity.
  - Groups they are members of.
  - Databases and tables they have write permission for.
- Root user can view all logs.

### Database and Table Management
- Create databases with visibility options:
  - **Private**: specify which users or groups are allowed to read or write.
  - **Public**: specify which users or groups are denied read or write.
- Tables inherit database permissions or can have custom permissions.
- Database and table ownership belongs to the user who created them.

### Data Management
- Support for autogenerated primary key IDs.
- Column restrictions supported:
  - `UNIQUE`
  - `NOT NULL`
- Supported data types:
  - `int`
  - `string`
  - `email`
  - `phone`
  - `date`

### Backup and Restore
- Root user can backup and restore the system data.
- Backup files are named by date, time, and a custom name.

## Planned Features

### Group Management
- Allow group owners to:
  - Change group passwords.
  - Kick users out of the group.
  - Transfer group ownership.

### Database and Table Management Enhancements
- Allow ownership transfer for databases and tables.

### Data Type Enhancements
- Remove current restrictions on the `string` type to allow any characters.

## Security Notes
- All sensitive information is handled securely.
- Passwords are hashed and salted.

## Usage Notes
- Users can only view or modify data if they have appropriate permissions.
- Root user has full control over the system.
